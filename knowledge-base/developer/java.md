# Downloading Java

## Java for Most Use Cases

Downloading Java is simple and straightforward. Oracle offers a simple download with a permissive license at its official download
page. Click the button below to be taken to this page.

Download Java at Oracle.com

Early-Access Builds

For developers that want to try out early-access builds, or builds by projects like Loom, Valhalla, and Panama, then you can find builds of these
at jdk.java.net.

## Install Java via Oracle Java Platform Extension for Visual Studio Code

Already a Visual Studio Code user wanting to start development with Java? Look no further!

The Oracle Java Platform extension helps you develop your Java project, and it is available via Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
If no JDK is present in your system then the extension can set it up for you via its built-in JDK Downloader:

You can also access the JDK Downloader through the Visual Studio Code menu: `View > Command Palette > Download, install, and Use JDK` option in the command palette.
This setup provides options for Oracle JDK, OpenJDK, but also allows you to choose from any locally installed JDKs.
If you already have JDK binaries downloaded in your system, you can point the JDK Downloader to their specific path.

Click `Install and start setup` button and enjoy coding with Java!

## The Future of Java

Learn about the future of the Java Platform

### Where Is the Java Language Going?

Join Brian Goetz (Java Language Architect) on a whirlwind tour of recent enhancements and future directions for the Java language with a special emphasis on Project Amber and Project Valhalla.

### From Cowboy Mode to Careful Stewardship

Java is a 30-year success story, made possible because its development consistently aligned with users' needs. In its early days, the platform required new features quickly, but over time, minimizing code breakage while carefully evolving the platform became essential. Critical junctures along that path included the introduction of modules and the current strive toward integrity by default.

### Java for AI

Many Java features, existing and future, can meet the demands of AI. Existing features include the Foreign Function and Memory API and the Vector API. Future features include those proposed by Project Valhalla and Project Babylon. This video discusses these features and how they might be used by Java libraries and applications to build competitive AI solutions.

### Integrity by Default

To assist performance, portability, and security, the Java Platform is progressing toward a state where its abstractions, as well as programmer-defined abstractions, can be made robust and invariants can be locally guaranteed. Libraries may violate some invariants but only if selectively allowed by the application. This session covers the why and how of the vision of "Integrity by Default".
