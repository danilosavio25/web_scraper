* copyCopy link
* docsView source
* bug\_reportReport issue

Learn how to use any Code OSS-based editor, such as VS Code,
to set up your Flutter development environment and
test drive Flutter's developer experience.

If you've developed with Flutter before,
or you prefer to use a different editor or IDE,
you can follow the custom setup instructions instead.

info
What you'll achieve

* Install the software prerequisites for Flutter.
* Use VS Code to download and install Flutter.
* Create a new Flutter app from a sample template.
* Try out Flutter development features like stateful hot reload.

## Confirm your development platform

The instructions on this page are configured to cover
installing and trying out Flutter on a **Windows**
device.

If you'd like to follow the instructions for a different OS,
please select one of the following.

Windows

macOS

Linux

ChromeOS

## Download prerequisite software

For the smoothest Flutter setup,
first install the following tools.

1. ### Set up Linux support

   If you haven't set up Linux support on your Chromebook before,
   Turn on Linux support.

   If you've already turned on Linux support,
   ensure it's up to date following the
   Fix problems with Linux
   instructions.
2. ### Download and install prerequisite packages

   Using `apt-get` or your preferred installation mechanism,
   install the latest versions of the following packages:

   * `curl`
   * `git`
   * `unzip`
   * `xz-utils`
   * `zip`
   * `libglu1-mesa`

   If you want to use `apt-get`,
   install these packages using the following commands:

   ```
   $ sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
   $ sudo apt-get install -y curl git unzip xz-utils zip libglu1-mesa
   ```

   content\_copy
3. ### Download and install Visual Studio Code

   To quickly install Flutter, then edit and debug your apps,
   install and set up Visual Studio Code.

   You can instead install and use any other Code OSS-based editor
   that supports VS Code extensions.

   assume VS Code refers to the editor of your choice.

1. ### Install git

   **If you already have git installed, skip to the next
   step: Download and install Visual Studio Code.**

   There are a few ways to install git on your Mac,
   but the way we recommend is by using XCode.
   This will be important when you target your
   builds for iOS or macOS.

   ```
   $ xcode-select --install
   ```

   content\_copy

   If you haven't installed the tools already,
   a dialog should open that confirms you'd like to install them.
   Click **Install**, then once the installation is complete, click
   **Done**.

## Install and set up Flutter

Now that you've installed Git and VS Code,
follow these steps to use VS Code to install and set up Flutter.

info
Download manually

If you prefer to manually install Flutter,
follow the instructions in Install Flutter manually.

1. ### Launch VS Code

   If not already open, open VS Code by searching for it with Spotlight
   or opening it manually from the directory where it's installed.
2. ### Add the Flutter extension to VS Code

   To add the Dart and Flutter extensions to VS Code,
   visit the Flutter extension's marketplace page,
   then click **Install**.
   If prompted by your browser, allow it to open VS Code.
3. ### Install Flutter with VS Code

   1. Open the command palette in VS Code.

      Go to **View** > **Command Palette**
      or press `Cmd/Ctrl` +
      `Shift` + `P`.
   2. In the command palette, type `flutter`.
   3. Select **Flutter: New Project**.
   4. VS Code prompts you to locate the Flutter SDK on your computer.
      Select **Download SDK**.
   5. When the **Select Folder for Flutter SDK** dialog displays,
      choose where you want to install Flutter.
   6. Click **Clone Flutter**.

      While downloading Flutter, VS Code displays this pop-up notification:

      ```
      Downloading the Flutter SDK. This may take a few minutes.
      ```

      content\_copy

      This download takes a few minutes.
      If you suspect that the download has hung, click **Cancel** then
      start the installation again.
   7. Click **Add SDK to PATH**.

      When successful, a notification displays:

      ```
      The Flutter SDK was added to your PATH
      ```

      content\_copy
   8. VS Code might display a Google Analytics notice.

      If you agree, click **OK**.
   9. To ensure that Flutter is available in all terminals:

      1. Close, then reopen all terminal windows.
      2. Restart VS Code.
4. ### Troubleshoot installation issues

   If you encounter any issues during installation,
   check out Flutter installation troubleshooting.

## Test drive Flutter

Now that you've set up VS Code and Flutter,
it's time to create an app and try out Flutter development!

1. ### Create a new Flutter app

   1. Open the command palette in VS Code.

      Go to **View** > **Command Palette**
      or press `Cmd/Ctrl` +
      `Shift` + `P`.
   2. In the command palette, start typing `flutter:`.

      VS Code should surface commands from the Flutter plugin.
   3. Select the **Flutter: New Project** command.

      Your OS or VS Code might ask for access to your documents,
      agree to continue to the next step.
   4. Choose the **Application** template.

      VS Code should prompt you with **Which Flutter template?**.
      Choose **Application** to bootstrap a simple counter app.
   5. Create or select the parent directory for your new app's folder.

      A file dialog should appear.

      1. Select or create the parent directory where
         you want the project to be created.
      2. To confirm your selection,
         click **Select a folder to create the project in**.
   6. Enter a name for your app.

      VS Code should prompt you to enter a name for your new app.
      Enter `trying_flutter` or a similar `lowercase_with_underscores`
      name.
      To confirm your selection, press `Enter`.
   7. Wait for project initialization to complete.

      Task progress is often surfaced as a notification in the bottom right
      and can also be accessed from the **Output** panel.
   8. Open the `lib` directory, then the `main.dart` file.

      If you're curious about what each portion of the code does,
      check out the preceding comments throughout the file.
2. ### Run your app on the web

   While Flutter apps can run on many platforms,
   try running your new app on the web.

   1. Open the command palette in VS Code.

      Go to **View** > **Command Palette**
      or press `Cmd/Ctrl` +
      `Shift` + `P`.
   2. In the command palette, start typing `flutter:`.

      VS Code should surface commands from the Flutter plugin.
   3. Select the **Flutter: Select Device** command.
   4. From the **Select Device** prompt, select **Chrome**.
   5. Run or start debugging your app.

      Go to **Run** >
      **Start Debugging** or press `F5`.

      `flutter run` is used to build and start your app,
      then a new instance of Chrome should open and
      start running your newly created app.
3. ### Try hot reload

   Flutter offers a fast development cycle with **stateful hot reload**,
   the ability to reload the code of a live running app without
   restarting or losing app state.

   You can change your app's source code,
   run the hot reload command in VS Code,
   then see the change in your running app.

   1. In the running app, try adding to the counter a few times by
      clicking the !increment (+)
      button.
   2. With your app still running, make a change in the `lib/main.dart` file.

      Change the `_counter++` line in the `_incrementCounter` method
      to instead decrement the `_counter` field.

      dart

      ```
      setState(() {
        // ...
        _counter++;
        _counter--;
      });
      ```

      content\_copy
   3. Save your changes
      (**File** > **Save All**) or
      click the **Hot Reload** !hot reload icon
      button.

      Flutter updates the running app without losing any existing state.
      Notice the existing value stayed the same.
   4. Try clicking the
      button again.
      Notice the value decreases instead of increases.
4. ### Explore the Flutter sidebar

   The Flutter plugin adds a dedicated sidebar to VS Code
   for managing Flutter debug sessions and devices,
   viewing an outline of your code and widgets,
   as well as accessing the Dart and Flutter DevTools.

   1. If your app isn't running, start debugging it again.

      Go to **Run** >
      **Start Debugging** or press `F5`.
   2. Open the Flutter sidebar in VS Code.

      Either open it with the Flutter !Flutter logo
      button in
      the VS Code sidebar or open it from the command palette by
      running the **Flutter: Focus on Flutter Sidebar View** command.
   3. In the Flutter sidebar, under **DevTools**,
      click the **Flutter Inspector** button.

      A separate **Widget Inspector** panel should open in VS Code.

      In the widget inspector, you can view your app's widget tree,
      view the properties and layout of each widget, and more.
   4. In the widget inspector, try clicking the top-level `MyHomePage` widget.

      A view of its properties and layout should open, and
      the VS Code editor should navigate to and focus the line where
      the widget was included.
   5. Explore and try out other features in
      the widget inspector and Flutter sidebar.
