# Spring makes Java simple. modern. productive. reactive. cloud-ready.

[Why Spring](/why-spring)[Quickstart](/quickstart)

# What Spring can do

[![Generative AI](/img/icons/ai.svg)

## Generative AI

Integrate AI into your Spring applications without reinventing the wheel.](/ai)

[![Microservices](/img/icons/microservices.svg)

## Microservices

Quickly deliver production‑grade features with independently evolvable microservices.](/microservices)

[![Reactive](/img/icons/reactive.svg)

## Reactive

Spring's asynchronous, nonblocking architecture means you can get more from your computing resources.](/reactive)

[![Cloud](/img/icons/cloud.svg)

## Cloud

Your code, any cloud—we’ve got you covered. Connect and scale your services, whatever your platform.](/cloud)

[![Web apps](/img/icons/web-apps.svg)

## Web apps

Frameworks for fast, secure, and responsive web applications connected to any data store.](/web-applications)

[![Serverless](/img/icons/serverless.svg)

## Serverless

The ultimate flexibility. Scale up on demand and scale to zero when there’s no demand.](/serverless)

[![Event Driven](/img/icons/event-driven.svg)

## Event Driven

Integrate with your enterprise. React to business events. Act on your streaming data in realtime.](/event-driven)

[![Batch](/img/icons/batch.svg)

## Batch

Automated tasks. Offline processing of data at a time to suit you.](/batch)

```
@SpringBootApplication  
@RestController  
public class DemoApplication {  


@GetMapping("/helloworld")  
public String hello() {

return"Hello World!";

}

}
```

## Level up your Java™ code

With [Spring Boot](/projects/spring-boot) in your app, just a few lines of code is all you need to start building services like a boss.

![Quote](/img/extra/quote.svg)

Most [of our] services today are all based on Spring Boot. I think the most important thing is that [Spring] has just been very well maintained over the years...that is important for us for the long term because we don’t want to be switching to a new framework every two years.
