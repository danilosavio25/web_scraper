# Why Spring?

Spring makes programming Java quicker, easier, and safer for everybody. Spring’s
focus on speed, simplicity, and productivity has made it the
[world's most popular](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2023/java/)
Java framework.

![](/img/extra/quote-2.svg)![](/img/extra/quote-2-dark.svg)

“We use a lot of the tools that come with the Spring framework and reap the benefits of having a lot of the out of the box solutions, and not having to worry about writing a ton of additional code—so that really saves us some time and energy.”

SEAN GRAHAM, APPLICATION TRANSFORMATION LEAD, DICK’S SPORTING GOODS

# Spring is everywhere

![](/img/icons/spring-is-everywhere.svg)![](/img/icons/spring-is-everywhere-dark.svg)

Spring’s flexible libraries are trusted by developers all over the world. Spring delivers delightful experiences to millions of end-users every day—whether that’s [streaming TV](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/netflix-oss-and-spring-boot-coming-full-circle-4855947713a0), [online shopping](https://tech.target.com/2018/12/18/spring-feign.html), or countless other innovative solutions. Spring also has contributions from all the big names in tech, including Alibaba, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and more.

# Spring is flexible

![](/img/icons/spring-is-flexible.svg)![](/img/icons/spring-is-flexible-dark.svg)

Spring’s flexible and comprehensive set of extensions and third-party libraries let developers build almost any application imaginable. At its core, Spring Framework’s [Inversion of Control (IoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) and [Dependency Injection (DI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) features provide the foundation for a wide-ranging set of features and functionality. Whether you’re building secure, reactive, cloud-based microservices for the web, or complex streaming data flows for the enterprise, Spring has the tools to help.

# Spring is productive

![](/img/icons/spring-is-productive.svg)![](/img/icons/spring-is-productive-dark.svg)

[Spring Boot](/guides/gs/spring-boot/) transforms how you approach Java programming tasks, radically streamlining your experience. Spring Boot combines necessities such as an application context and an auto-configured, embedded web server to make [microservice](/microservices) development a cinch. To go even faster, you can combine Spring Boot with Spring Cloud’s rich set of supporting libraries, servers, patterns, and templates, to safely deploy entire microservices-based architectures into the [cloud](/cloud), in record time.

# Spring is fast

![](/img/icons/spring-is-fast.svg)![](/img/icons/spring-is-fast-dark.svg)

Our engineers care deeply about performance. With Spring, you’ll notice fast startup, fast shutdown, and optimized execution, by default. Increasingly, Spring projects also support the [reactive](/reactive) (nonblocking) programming model for even greater efficiency. Developer productivity is Spring’s superpower. Spring Boot helps developers build applications with ease and with far less toil than other competing paradigms. Embedded web servers, auto-configuration, and “fat jars” help you get started quickly, and innovations like [LiveReload in Spring DevTools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-devtools-livereload) mean developers can iterate faster than ever before. You can even start a new Spring project in seconds, with the Spring Initializr at [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/).

# Spring is secure

![](/img/icons/spring-is-secure.svg)![](/img/icons/spring-is-secure-dark.svg)

Spring has a proven track record of dealing with security issues quickly and responsibly. The Spring committers work with security professionals to patch and test any reported vulnerabilities. Third-party dependencies are also monitored closely, and regular updates are issued to help keep your data and applications as safe as possible. In addition, [Spring Security](/projects/spring-security) makes it easier for you to integrate with industry-standard security schemes and deliver trustworthy solutions that are secure by default.

# Spring is supportive

![](/img/icons/spring-is-supportive.svg)![](/img/icons/spring-is-supportive-dark.svg)

The [Spring community](/community) is enormous, global, diverse, and spans folks of all ages and capabilities, from complete beginners to seasoned pros. No matter where you are on your journey, you can find the support and resources you need to get you to the next level: [quickstarts](/quickstart), [videos](/guides>guides & tutorials</a>, <a href=), [meetups](/events), [support](/support), or even formal [training and certification.](/training)
