# React Community

React has a community of millions of developers. On this page we’ve listed some React-related communities that you can be a part of; see the other pages in this section for additional online and in-person learning materials.

## Code of Conduct

Before participating in React’s communities, [please read our Code of Conduct.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) We have adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and we expect that all community members adhere to the guidelines within.

## Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow is a popular forum to ask code-level questions or if you’re stuck with a specific error. Read through the [existing questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reactjs) tagged with **reactjs** or [ask your own](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=reactjs)!

## Popular Discussion Forums

There are many online forums which are a great place for discussion about best practices and application architecture as well as the future of React. If you have an answerable code-level question, Stack Overflow is usually a better fit.

Each community consists of many thousands of React users.
