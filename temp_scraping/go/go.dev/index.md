* “At the time, no single team member knew Go, but
  **within a month, everyone was writing in Go** and we were
  building out the endpoints. It was the flexibility, how easy it was to use,
  and the really cool concept behind Go (how Go handles native concurrency,
  garbage collection, and of course safety+speed.) that helped engage us
  during the build. Also, who can beat that cute mascot!”

  — Jaime Enrique Garcia Lopez,
  Senior Software Development Manager
   at Capital One
* "**A small language that compiles fast makes for a happy developer.**
  The Go language is small, compiles really fast, and as a result it lets your
  mind focus on the actual problem and less on the tool you are using to solve
  it. Code, test, debug cycles are so quick that you forget you are not
  working with an interpreted language. Looking at our code, you see
  **less boilerplate and more business logic.**"

  — Clayton Coleman,
  Lead Engineer, Open Shift
   at RedHat
* “**Go has excellent characteristics for scalability and services
  written using it typically have very small memory footprints.**
  Because code is compiled into a single static binary, services can also be
  containerised with ease, making it much simpler to build and deploy. These
  attributes make **Go an ideal choice for companies building
  microservices**, as you can easily deploy into a highly available and
  scalable environment such as Kubernetes.”

  — Matt Boyle,
  Lead Software Engineer
   at Curve
* "In our tightly managed environments where we run Go code,
  **we have seen a CPU reduction of approximately 10%**
  with cleaner and maintainable code."

  — Bala Natarajan,
  Sr. Director of Engineering, Developer Experience
   at PayPal
* "Tooling has always been a problem with our legacy code base... but we have
  found that Go has excellent tooling, plus built-in testing, benchmarking,
  and profiling frameworks. It is easy to write efficient and resilient
  applications. **After working on Go, most of our developers don't want
  to go back to other languages.**"

  — Benjamin Cane,
  Vice President and Principal Engineer
   at American Express
* "...when a programming language is designed for exactly the environment most
  of us use right now—scalable, cloud-based servers that are optimized for
  performance—a lot can go right."

  — John Biggs and Ben Popper,
   at Stack Overflow
