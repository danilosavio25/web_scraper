Is it possible to hide everything unrelated to particular standard? It should be, because all the "before C++14, since C++14", "before C++17, since C++17" make pages hard to read. For example, look at [tuple constructor](cpp/utility/tuple/tuple.html "cpp/utility/tuple/tuple"). It would be nice to be able to hide everything unrelated to C++17 <or some other> standard. â Preceding unsigned comment added by [Hedede](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User:Hedede&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Hedede (page does not exist)") ([talk](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Hedede&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:Hedede (page does not exist)") â¢ [contribs](https://en.cppreference.com/w/Special:Contributions/Hedede "Special:Contributions/Hedede")) 21:04, 12 December 2017 (PST)â

## [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=Talk:Main_Page&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Usefulness of translated sites")] Usefulness of translated sites

Does anyone have strong feelings about the usefulness of the non-english subsites?

I've gotten a non-trivial amount of feedback from non-english speakers saying that the autotranslated content on those sites is at best useless (it's not very readable and quickly falls out of sync with the english-language content) and at worst disruptive (it can contaminate search results, making it harder for good results to bubble to the top).

People have been making changes to the non-english subsites, but at a very low rate compared to the english site. I don't like the idea of throwing out the translation work that people have done, but at some point the costs may outweigh the benefits.

Thoughts? --[Nate](User%253ANate.html "User:Nate") ([talk](User_talk%253ANate.html "User talk:Nate")) 10:05, 13 July 2016 (PDT)

:   I only heard bad things about the non-English cppreference as well. --[Cubbi](User%253ACubbi.html "User:Cubbi") ([talk](User_talk%253ACubbi.html "User talk:Cubbi")) 11:33, 13 July 2016 (PDT)

:   There has been significant amount of work in at least Russian and Chinese wikis and I think the content there is useful, especially given that we don't let search engines index autotranslated pages. The Chinese seems to be very active [even now](http://zh.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=Special:%E6%9C%80%E8%BF%91%E6%9B%B4%E6%94%B9&limit=500&days=90), although it's single person effort currently. Having said that the rest of the wikis are indeed not attracting interest and are unlikely to take off. I think we could export the content, backup it and shutdown the wikis. If someone thinks he wants to contribute significant amount of time, I could fire up a wiki with the archived content on a personal server on a personal domain for a month and during that time it would become clear if the contributor was serious or only talking. --[P12](User%253AP12.html "User:P12") 03:07, 1 February 2017 (PST)

    :   Hmm, do we want to make a decision on this? Shut down everything but en (of course), zh, and ru? I have an [AWB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AWB "enwiki:WP:AWB") bot set up to transform the piles of language links into {{[langlinks](https://en.cppreference.com/w/Template:langlinks "Template:langlinks")}}, but if we are doing this then that should probably wait.

        :   OTOH, if we convert to using the template, then we can globally suppress links to the removed languages in the template instead of cleaning up every page, and resurrecting a language - should we ever need to do that - can also be globally done in the template with a few edits.

A few years late to the party. I've been working to bring the Spanish version up to date, I have a few hours a week, but in case this discussion pops up again, don't shut the sites down. Eventually the idea is to promote es.cppreference.com in universities in Spain, Mexico. Latin America.

We've decided - I think - on merging {{[noexcept](https://en.cppreference.com/w/Template:noexcept "Template:noexcept")}} into the applicable function signatures, but there's no easy way to see which pages haven't been processed yet. What do people think of the following:

* Using [Special:ReplaceText](https://en.cppreference.com/w/Special:ReplaceText "Special:ReplaceText"), replace all current uses of {{[noexcept](https://en.cppreference.com/w/Template:noexcept "Template:noexcept")}} with a tracking template - say, {{[unreviewed noexcept](https://en.cppreference.com/w/Template:unreviewed_noexcept "Template:unreviewed noexcept")}} - which looks just like {{[noexcept](https://en.cppreference.com/w/Template:noexcept "Template:noexcept")}} but has a hidden tracking category added to it.
* We can then process the pages in the category and remove processed pages from the category, until it eventually becomes empty.

We could probably also do something similar with the <!--CWG 1234-->-style DR markers, most of which probably should go to {{[dr list item](https://en.cppreference.com/w/Template:dr_list_item "Template:dr list item")}}.

:   I think some (many?) of the hidden DR comments are there to tell the future editors why the text differs from published pre-DR standard. Great idea for the noexcept migration though. --[Cubbi](User%253ACubbi.html "User:Cubbi") ([talk](User_talk%253ACubbi.html "User talk:Cubbi")) 06:28, 31 March 2017 (PDT)

        :   true. I started reviewing all DRs manually when DR list was invented (that's what [User:Cubbi/Sandbox](User%253ACubbi/Sandbox.html "User:Cubbi/Sandbox") is about), but it fell to the bottom of priority list. --[Cubbi](User%253ACubbi.html "User:Cubbi") ([talk](User_talk%253ACubbi.html "User talk:Cubbi")) 10:56, 31 March 2017 (PDT)
    :   Also, do we want to keep the "Exceptions" section afterwards for simple cases (where we don't have anything to add beyond some combination of (none) and just {{[noexcept](https://en.cppreference.com/w/Template:noexcept "Template:noexcept")}})? I'm not sure I see much point in keeping them. [T. Canens](User%253AT._Canens.html "User:T. Canens") ([talk](User_talk%253AT._Canens.html "User talk:T. Canens")) 10:55, 31 March 2017 (PDT)

        :   Moving exceptions to the signature sounds fine, as long as the signatures can be formatted such that they're not too hard to parse.

## [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=Talk:Main_Page&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Exact match in search results")] Exact match in search results

When searching, if there is only one hit the site automatically redirects to that page. ([http://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?search=distance](../mwiki/index.php@search=distance.html))

When there are multiple results including an exact match, it does not automatically forward, although the exact match is listed on top. ([http://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?search=std%3A%3Alist](../mwiki/index.php@search=std%253A%253Alist.html))

This is particularly annoying since quite a lot of searches have two results, one in std and one in std::pmr for example (try searching for vector).

Would there be an easy way to (locally/using an extra GET argument?) change this behaviour, so that it always opens the first page on exact matches?

Also, I'm often too lazy to type the std:: part, but when searching 'set' for example, I usually just want the std::set.

P0777R1's changes from [std::decay](cpp/types/decay.html "cpp/types/decay") to std:remove\_cvref are behavioral no-ops, even though they might increase compiler throughput. I think revboxing the changes gives them more prominence than they deserve. Possible options I can think of:

* Keep the revboxen as is, even though they don't alter the behavior in any way.
* Drop them and use `remove_cvref` throughout even for pre-C++20 features.
* Drop them and keep using `decay` for pre-C++20 features (keep `remove_cvref` for new features in C++20 and later).
* Drop them and use remove\_cv\_t<remove\_reference\_t<...>> for pre-C++20 features

A resolution that meets most of demands is to show expressions in different standards, for example: use **remove\_cvref** in all examples (including pre-C++20 ones) and comment something like "Pre-C++20 can use **decay(...)** (or so) instead" so most of the users can find their interesting stuff. --[LittleFlower](User%253ALittleFlower.html "User:LittleFlower") ([talk](User_talk%253ALittleFlower.html "User talk:LittleFlower")) 18:35, 23 December 2017 (PST)

I've enabled the `Vector` skin to make the list of languages available in the left bar, because I'm from Spain and sometimes I accidentally enter to the Spanish autotranslated version of the site, usually from google searchs. So it's comfortable to me to just click to the English version to get out of there.

The problem is, each time I search for something and move to any other part of the site besides main page, I have to go back to the manual page manually. However, the built-in styles have a the very useful `cppreference.com` link to come back to main page, that is missing in vector.

Also, I've enabled the StandardRevisions gadget and it only works for the built-in styles as well. Is it possible to add support for going back to the main page and the StandardRevisions gadget to the vector style? [Peregringlk](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User:Peregringlk&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Peregringlk (page does not exist)") ([talk](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Peregringlk&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:Peregringlk (page does not exist)")) 02:36, 13 September 2019 (PDT)

:   It looks like support for the StandardRevisions switcher has been enabled for Vector, so that's handled. ð

:   To provide a link back to the main page, the simplest solution would seem to be editing [MediaWiki:sidebar](MediaWiki%253ASidebar.html "MediaWiki:Sidebar") to include

    ```
    ** mainpage|mainpage-description
    ```

    at the top of the first list section. That's normally part of the default sidebar, but was removed for some reason. Since the sidebar is only shown in Vector, which doesn't show the "cppreference.com" link at the top of the page, restoring it should be unproblematic I would think?

:   (The messages [Mediawiki:mainpage](MediaWiki%253AMainpage.html "MediaWiki:Mainpage") and [Mediawiki:mainpage-description](MediaWiki%253AMainpage-description.html "MediaWiki:Mainpage-description"), which are currently undefined and therefore defaulting to "Main Page" and "Main page", respectively) can also be set to customize the link. Setting [Mediawiki:mainpage-description](MediaWiki%253AMainpage-description.html "MediaWiki:Mainpage-description") to "cppreference.com" would cause the sidebar link to match the top-of-page link on the custom skin(s). It is possible to localize system messages, for example the default/current [Mediawiki:mainpage-description/es](MediaWiki%253AMainpage-description/es.html "MediaWiki:Mainpage-description/es") for the Spanish site is "PÃ¡gina principal". Though if it's going to be set to "cppreference.com" that probably doesn't even need localization.)

:   Another alternative (or, really, an additional possibility independent of the first suggestion) would be to create a logo image for the site, which could be shown at the top of the sidebar. Currently the logo (which links back to the main page) is present in the Vector rendering, but it's being suppressed in the site CSS because the logo image is still set to the [eyeball-searingly hideous default placeholder](../mwiki/skins/common/images/wiki.png). -- [FeRDNYC](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User:FeRDNYC&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:FeRDNYC (page does not exist)") ([talk](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User_talk:FeRDNYC&action=edit&redlink=1 "User talk:FeRDNYC (page does not exist)")) 08:13, 28 October 2021 (PDT)

:   Hi, Javier.

* The [std::format](cpp/utility/format/format.html) family is not implemented yet by **gcc/clang** (not sure about **cl**). To run the examples locally one can use the original [fmt](https://fmt.dev/latest/index.html) library, or better, use [gotbolt online compiler](https://godbolt.org) choosing the **fmt** library from the list of additional libraries and compile with flag `-std=c++20`.
* As to the cppreference's Online compilers, the following local discussion can shed the light on: [online compiler](MediaWiki_talk%253AGadget-ColiruCompiler.html). Note, that the online-compilers are the same - the latest available on Coliru - gcc-v10.2 (and clang-5.0) now. Cubbi has fixed the version's title by changing the [script (gadget)](MediaWiki%253AGadget-coliru_compiler.js.html) for English version. The same could be done for other languages/sites. For instance, on Spanish es.cppreference.com [this file](https://es.cppreference.com/w/MediaWiki:Gadget-coliru_compiler.js) may be updated (s/"9.2"/"10.2", or just plain copy from English version would be enough, but admin rights are necessary).

A Bonus: cppreference online compier version checker

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
int main() {
#if __clang__
  std::cout << "\nclang-" << __clang_major__ << '.' << __clang_minor__ << '\n';
#else
  std::cout << "\ngcc-" << __GNUC__ << "." << __GNUC_MINOR__ << '\n';
#endif
  // An alternative:
  system("g++ --version");
  system("clang++ --version");

When I do a search with the search box in the top-right corner it is now taking me to DuckDuckGo. The DuckDuckGo results I see are based on what I was actually searching for on cppreference but it's a bit jarring to suddenly be taken away from cppreference to a DuckDuckGo search results page. It was really nice the way the search worked before where it would take me right to the results within cppreference.

Is this behavior I'm seeing the way the search will work going forward or have I just stumbled upon a temporary issue?

The external search is a really, really bad idea and each result takes 4-10 lines per-hit. So instead of having a nice concise list of what is available on cppreference.com, you have a sprawling DuckDuckGo page that is a complete mess to find the result you want if it isn't in the first two or three results. I have worked with UI design since 1989 and I cannot fathom a worse move for cppreference.com to make.

Users who just find the site and can't stand the external search are not going to take the time to create an account on this site just to provide feedback for the new search (that's if they have 1/2 a clue how wiki internals and talk pages work to begin with). The complaints against the change will be wildly underrepresented, users will just find another reference site that has a cogent interface. Any "sample" that relies on casual site users going to the additional effort to create an account just to provide feedback is statistically invalid.

    :   I understand the frustrations with the new search, but the manual index was *far* from the only problem with the old search. Several of them are [discussed here](Cppreference_talk%253AFAQ.html#Search_on_site "Cppreference talk:FAQ"). Including...

        * Search was limited to a fixed number of matches (I think 20?) when there were often far more. Without a way to sort, if your desired match would be somewhere off the end of the list it was simply inaccessible.
        * It was impossible, with the old search, to match any articles with titles that contain characters reserved in HTML / HTTP queries, such as an `operator<<` of some class, e.g. [basic\_string::operator<<,>>()](cpp/string/basic_string/operator_ltltgtgt.html "cpp/string/basic string/operator ltltgtgt").  
           (DuckDuckGo does... *better*, with that. It looks like it ignores the <<, and just matches "operator" â but you can at least see the matches beyond the first page, unlike with the old search. Given the number of matches for "operator" on the site, the one you want is very likely to **not** be right up front.)

    :   @IP User: Technically that's true, but mostly because `border: inherit` resets the border width of those elements to 0. At that point the `box-sizing: border-box` has no effect, because borderless elements are the same size no matter how you measure. Therefore, agreed â that change does also serve as a workaround for the problem.
    :   Better, though (IMHO) to remove the ill-advised box-sizing rule, which makes everything fit the layout as-is.

All, thank you for your efforts, but the search box is still screwed up on Firefox for Linux. Here is a screenshot from today. <https://paste.opensuse.org/75444415> (image good for 30 days). I believe you need to force the border (or margin, or padding) of the box to zero in order for it to work properly on Linux.

Nobody implemented it, nobody uses it, nobody will implement it, there's no point in writing docs for it, and the javascript hacks to get auto-linking to work for shorter names cause issues for downstream users.

:   My opinion is like this. Emotionally, it is sad to jettison such a great work. But pragmatically, Ranges-TS` pages have fulfilled their progressive mission to be a medium (and playground) between the Proposal and the final IS, and, in light of the aforementioned circumstances, can go now into well-deserved retirement (RIP).
:   Probably, the same cleanup should be (conditionally) applied to some other experimental features/TSs when they were merged into the IS. With all respect to the creators of their appropriate pages!

## [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=Talk:Main_Page&action=edit&section=46 "Edit section: Install MediaWiki Extension:TemplateSandbox?")] Install MediaWiki Extension:TemplateSandbox?

The MediaWiki standard [Extension:TemplateSandbox](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TemplateSandbox) is handy not so much for the *sandbox* ability itself, but for a related feature it brings with it: The ability to preview the results of a template edit *in situ* on any page requested, prior to saving the edit and making it live.

The extension adds a field to the editor view (when editing in a namespace configured in `$wgTemplateSandboxEditNamespaces`), offering to "Preview page with this template". There you can type any page title (presumably one which transcludes the template being edited), and it'll present a rendered view of the page as if your changes had been made live, but **without** them actually being made live yet.

Especially on sites where templates are heavily-used, deeply nested, intricately designed, or sparsely documented â and cppreference hits the quadfecta(?) by meeting **all four** of those criteria â it beats the more traditional "Edit, Save, Panic, Adjust, Save, Revert" loop that even experienced template coders often find themselves falling into, when attempting to make changes to live templates. As such, it also helps less-experienced editors make changes more confidently, and lowers the barrier to entry for new contributors to get involved in maintaining the site's frontend infrastructure.

Any possibility this highly-useful extension could find its was into the local MediaWiki install?

The descriptions of singleton object are treated differently.

type and its singleton object described in the same page:

* [cpp/utility/in\_place](cpp/utility/in_place.html "cpp/utility/in place") (the page is named after one of their singleton objects)
* [cpp/memory/new/destroying\_delete\_t](cpp/memory/new/destroying_delete_t.html "cpp/memory/new/destroying delete t") (the page is named after its class)

type and its singleton object described in separate pages:

* [cpp/utility/piecewise\_construct\_t](cpp/utility/piecewise_construct_t.html "cpp/utility/piecewise construct t") and [cpp/utility/piecewise\_construct](cpp/utility/piecewise_construct.html "cpp/utility/piecewise construct")

For example, in page [cpp/memory/new](cpp/memory/new.html "cpp/memory/new"), nothrow\_t and nothrow are classified as a class and an object, however, destroying\_delete\_t and destroying\_delete share the same page, as well as the same link, classified as a class.

Similar situations also occurred in function and its corresponding constants/helper classes, but with even worse cases, such as:

* function and its corresponding constants/helper classes described in the same page or separate pages
* a group of functions with similar goals or a common goal described in the same page or separate pages
* functions (of few relation) described alone, with their corresponding constants collected together in a general summary page

Not to mention their links in summary pages and code blocks. It is tough to conclude due to its complexity so we'd better reach a consensus before further modifications.

+, -, \*, /, %, ++n, --n, n++, n--, +=, -=, \*=, /=, %=

Is there a GNU C++ switch that will turn off all of these floating point overflow and underflow values, both for assignment of the floating point data and arithmetic operator calculation for separate floating point data, too? How can this be acheived without adjusting the floating point source code at all?

It is very convenient that identifiers in the code blocks are auto detected and link to their corresponding function/class/.. pages. I've been thinking if it is feasible that header inclusions in the code could also be detected and link to their corresponding header pages?

For example, following code in cpp pages: (I attempted to use {{lc}} but got broken result, so I used {{c}} instead)

#include <string>

code "<string>" will become a link to [cpp/header/string](cpp/header/string.html "cpp/header/string")

* It mentions `key_type`, while [the standard says](https://eel.is/c++draft/container.requirements#container.node.overview-4) "using key\_type = see below; // not present for set containers"
* It specifies "iterator - Constant LegacyBidirectionalIterator to value\_type" and "const\_iterator - LegacyBidirectionalIterator to const value\_type" while [the standard says](https://eel.is/c++draft/container.requirements#associative.reqmts.general-6) "both iterator and const\_Â­iterator are constant iterators" so the description should be identical between iterator and const\_iterator (the latter is the accurate one)

I write here because I'm not totally sure how to fix the relevant templates and anyway wanted this to be reviewed in case I misread it

:   :   @ Benio.

        * Splitting into multiple excerpts is sub-optimal, as it also places a burden on maintainers to invent a new name for each "excerpt" and update such templates when another compiler adds support for a corresponding C++ feature.
        * Our wiki system will become overwhelmed with such âexcerptsâ, one per each Compiler Support Table (CST) row, which will put an even higher load on the system than the *automatic* `D41D8CD98F`'s JavaScript solution.
        * The âexcerptâ, as it's implemented now, duplicates some information already available on documentation page: revision, feature description, and (FTM)\* block - that's not ideal. :-)
    :   If not via an *automatic* script, the "support status" could be implemented using a single (per table) combined script that contains all entries/rows and several MediaWiki switches accepting a few arguments.
    :   Another question: do the documentation pages truly require âsupport statusâ tables? It is debatable. The existing small FTM tables already link to the CSTs under the "Value" column. A potential improvement would be to add links to CSTs for those features that do not have FTMs. This could be implemented as a small box with a link and explanatory text, similar to this one: [[CST](cpp/compiler_support/26.html#cpp_contracts_202502L "cpp/compiler support/26")], with optional CSS styling.
    :   If "Support status" sections are deemed desirable, they should be distinct from the CST row. There is no point to show compilers that do not support a given feature. Only those compilers that at least partially support a feature should be displayed on the documentation page.

Is there a way to resolve this problem in unifying its format of naming or declaring exposition-only items? It would be nice if there is a template in wrapping such names inside dcl template to italicize it just like how `boolean-testable` is automatically italicized on [cpp/concepts/predicate](cpp/concepts/predicate.html "cpp/concepts/predicate").

[zh:Template:title](http://zh.cppreference.com/w/Template:title "zh:Template:title") was vandalized in June 2024, then locked after restoration, but the restored version introduced an unexpected line break (compare with [en:Template:title](http://en.cppreference.com/w/Template:title "en:Template:title")), causing spacing issues in titles.
